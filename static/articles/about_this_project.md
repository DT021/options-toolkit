# Motivation

My goal is not to provide the most sophisticated tool to consider all the technical factors.

To show what one can do in the financial market with reasonable amount of time and effort.

Provide an educational experience for myself and others.

# Collaboration

I have zero experience on how to develop an app or write program the correct way. I did have a degree that combines computer science and physics but it is more about the theory and less about real-life work experience.

one hesitation is that I may not be able to handle the demand for collaboration. i may be slow or I may even have to walk away from the project.
