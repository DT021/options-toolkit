# options-toolkit
Simple tools that assist options trading and education.
This project is under GNU GPL 3.0 license, in order to encourage learning, sharing, and collaboration.

# Background
I am neither a professional trader or a professional programmer (please don't judge my code; I know it looks amateurish). I am developing this toolkit because:
- I am interested in learning more about options, and developing an app would be an effective way to learn and put my knowledge into practice.
- I would like to develop tools that suit the needs of my investment strategy, to complement, not in place of, other tools I am using (which is why this is project is a "toolkit" rather than a "solution." Also, building an app from the ground-up is also more practical.)
- I would like to gain some programming skills so that I can develop apps that relate to my careers and other interests.
- I am interested in helping people around me learn investing, and i would like to figure out ways to make options more intuitive for people to learn (hence data visualization is an important aspect of this project.)
- I would like to use this opportunity to communicate with people, get to know who they are and what they want, and even make friends.

# Contribute
Any contribution is appreciated, whether it's coding, testing, or general suggestions/recommendations regarding investing strategies, data visualizations, backend/frontend packages, and UI/UX.
